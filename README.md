## Summary

Graduate M.Sc in Computational Cognitive Neuroscience. Hoping to further my experience in data analysis and modelling.

I enjoy working with data and figuring out the type of story a data might tell. In my spare time, I like to learn more about time series, such as the use of statistical modelling or with the use of a neural network architecture in improving forecasting of demands or environmental data.

Currently, I am learning in the area of NLP.
